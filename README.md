## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal learning journey for mastering Flask and various backend technologies in Python. Here, I explore key concepts like RESTful APIs, databases, authentication, and deployment, among others. 

The goal is to progressively build applications and showcase how Python, specifically Flask, can be used to create scalable, efficient backend systems.

## Technologies Used

In this repository, I explore and experiment with the following technologies:

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building backend APIs.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit for Python for database management.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database for development purposes.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Authentication using token-based methods.
- **Flask-RESTful**: Extension for Flask to build REST APIs.
- **Flask-Migrate**: Handles SQLAlchemy database migrations.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application.
- **Gunicorn**: A WSGI HTTP Server for running Flask apps in production.
- **Postman**: API testing tool used for testing endpoints.
- **pytest**: Unit testing framework for Python.
